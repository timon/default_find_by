DefaultFindBy
=============

(Yet another) solution to literal URLs and permalinks.

After I found myself redefining <tt>to_param</tt> on my models and changing
controllers load code, I had created this plugin.

You give it a name of the field. It takes that name, defines <tt>to_param</tt>
to return value of that field, and makes <tt>find</tt> use
<tt>find_by_<i>that_field</i></tt> when it is given the string.



Example
=======

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
       # Post (id: integer, title: string, body: text)
       default_find_by :title
    end


Testing
=======
To test this plugin, you'll need rspec, rspec-rails and nakajima-acts_as_fu
gems installed.
